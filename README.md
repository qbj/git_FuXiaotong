# Hi, Im FuXiaotong, a growing Data Scientist.
# This is the workspace for Myself

 I divided it into 4 parts:
1.Data Engine
  - To study how to make good data. e.g. data sourcing, data clean, ETL...
2.Data Analysis
  - To study how to analyze data. e.g. Machine Learning, Data Mining, Pivot, Drill, Slice, Statistics, Probabilistics...
3.Data Visualization
  - To study how to see our data. e.g. Reporting, Graph, Map, 3D ...
4.Projects
  - Some practice cases.
  
Data are the source of our knowledge, knowing it better means becoming a wiser person. 
Welcome you to discover the truth behind the data with me.
